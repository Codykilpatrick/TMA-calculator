## Background information ‚õ¥Ô∏è
Target Motion Analysis (TMA) is a process to determine the position of a target using passive sensor information. Sensors like passive RADAR and SONAR provide directional and occasionally frequency information. TMA is done by marking from which direction the sound comes at different times, and comparing the motion with that of the operator's own ship. Changes in relative motion are analyzed using standard geometrical techniques along with some assumptions about limiting cases.

## Problem description üë®‚Äçüíª
Right now if you were to do this by hand it would take you ~5 minutes, a white board, a scientific calculator, trigonometry/algebra/geometry knowledge, and advanced TMA experience.

This takes critical resources in the form of mental bandwidth away from senior members of the ASW team. It can lead to misclassification, loss of situational awareness and other mistakes.
